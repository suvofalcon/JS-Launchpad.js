/*****
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

//heightMark = 1.88
//heightJohn = 1.76
//weightMark = 95
//weightJohn = 85


bmiMark = weightMark / heightMark ** 2;
bmiJohn = weightJohn / heightJohn ** 2;
console.log('BMI of Mark ' + bmiMark)

    console.log(`Mark has a higher BMI - ${bmiMark}`)
